# Image-Denoising-with-Autoencoders

Getting Started
---------------
**Image Deonising with Autoencoders** project introduces a novel approach
to denoise noisy images with Autoencoders. Here we make use of the Convolutional
Autoencoders to build and train a Deep Neural Network which learns to remove noise 
from an image

Prerequisites
-------------
The following libraries are used for the project:

    opencv-python
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    tensorflow
    
    
Deep Neural Network Architecture

Dataset
-------

In contrast to a classification problem, an autoencoder generates images.
Hence we require only a very small dataset as this falls under a 
regression problem.

How to test the saved model?
----------------------------

Go to the folder model and run the file inference.py
